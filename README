TODO:
    ffmpeg update seems to now consider many test files to be planar, which
        it didn't before (3 failures before upgrade, 16 after).
        Add logic to handle both planar audio files and 32 bit depths
    Make Makefile useful to ops
    Full check against all WD audio test files
    Pass in color information
    More intuitive command arguments.
    Add options for and experiment with different drawing modes:
        - [x] max, solid color
        - [x] max, two color linear gradient
        - [ ] average over max, solid color for each
        - [ ] average over max, two color linear gradient for each
