Command Line Usage:

    Available options with their defaults:
    -i [REQUIRED]               Input file to parse
    -o [optional]               Output file for PNG (stdout if omitted)
    -h 64                       Height of output image. The height of each channel will be constrained
                                so that all channels can fit within the specified height
    -t 64                       Height of each track in the output image. The final height of the
                                output png will be this value multiplied by the number of channels
                                in the audio stream
    -w 256                      Width of output PNG image
    -m                          Produce a single channel waveform. Each channel will be averaged
                                together to produce the final channel.
